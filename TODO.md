# TODO List for Git in Go

## General

- [ ] Reach parity with actual Git - create/maintain all the same files & directories, make commands have the same behavior, etc. Refer to https://blog.meain.io/2023/what-is-in-dot-git/ and other resources in the "Initialize the .git directory" stage.

## Housekeeping/Tech Debt

- [ ] Update [README](README.md) with information about implementation and usage
- [ ] Write a blog post or something that has better/clearer documentation of packfile object schemas than what's currently out there
